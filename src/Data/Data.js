    body: `# Historical theories of art
#### April 1, 1979 by [Jerrold Levinson](/)
The philosopher primarily associated with the historical definition of art is Jerrold Levinson (1979). 
For Levinson, "a work of art is a thing intended for regard-as-a-work-of-art: regard in any of the ways works of art existing prior to it have been correctly regarded" (1979, p. 234). Levinson further clarifies that by "intends for" he means: "[M]akes, appropriates or conceives for the purpose of'" (1979, p. 236). Some of these manners for regard (at around the present time) are: to be regarded with full attention, to be regarded contemplatively, to be regarded with special notice to appearance, to be regarded with "emotional openness" (1979, p. 237). 
If an object isn't intended for regard in any of the established ways, then it isn't art.
Historical theories of art hold that for something to be art, it must bear some relation to 
existing works of art.[8] For new works to be art, they must be similar or relate to previously 
established artworks. Such a definition raises the question of where this inherited status originated. 
That is why historical definitions of art must also include a disjunct for first art 
something is art if it possesses a historical relation to previous artworks, or is first art.
## What is "art"?
How best to define the term "art" is a subject of constant contention; many books and journal articles h
ave been published arguing over even the basics of what we mean by the term "art".[15] Theodor Adorno claimed in his Aesthetic Theory 1969 "It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident."[16] Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists and programmers all use the notion of art in their respective fields, 
and give it operational definitions that vary considerably
### What should art be like?
Many goals have been argued for art, and aestheticians often argue that some goal or another 
is superior in some way. Clement Greenberg, for instance, argued in 1960 that each artistic medium 
should seek that which makes it unique among the possible mediums and then purify itself of anything 
other than expression of its own uniqueness as a form.[23] The Dadaist Tristan Tzara on the other hand 
saw the function 
of art in 1918 as the destruction of a mad social order. "We must sweep and clean
### The value of art
Tolstoy defined art as the following: "Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings
 he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings and also experience them.
- However, this definition is merely a starting point for his theory of art's value. To some extent, 
the value of art, for Tolstoy, is one with the value of empathy.
- In chapter fifteen of What Is Art?, Tolstoy says that some feelings are good, but others are bad,
 and so art is only valuable when it generates empathy or shared feeling for good feelings.
- For example, Tolstoy asserts that empathy for decadent members of the ruling class makes society worse, rather than better. In chapter sixteen, 
he asserts that the best art is "universal art" that expresses simple and accessible positive feeling.
1.  A set theory of art has been underlined in according to the notion that everything is art. Here - higher than such states is proposed while lower than such states
 is developed for reference; thus showing that art theory is sprung up to guard against complacency.
2. A set example of this would be an eternal set large enough to incorporate everything; 
with a work of art-example given as Ben Vautier's 'Universe'.
3.  A set of this would be an infinite set consisting of every parallel universe; with a work of
 art-example given as Marvels 'Omniverse'.`,

    body: `# Culture
#### March 23, 2020 by [Groh, Arnold A](/)
## Overview
In the 19th century, "culture" was used by some to refer to a wide array of human activities, 
and by some others as a synonym for "civilization". In the 20th century, anthropologists began theorizing 
about culture as an object of scientific analysis. Some used it to distinguish human adaptive strategies 
from the largely instinctive adaptive strategies of animals, including the adaptive strategies of other
 primates and non-human hominids, whereas others used it to refer to symbolic representations and expressions 
 of human experience,with no direct adaptive value. Both groups understood culture as being definitive of human nature.

Morbi leo risus, porta ac consectetur ac, vestibulum at eros.
## History
Cultural bias may also arise in historical scholarship when the standards, assumptions and conventions of 
the historian's own era are anachronistically used to report and to assess events of the past. 
The tendency is sometimes known as presentism and is regarded by many historians as a fault to be avoided.
 Arthur Marwick has argued that "a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, 
 and... very difficult to get to know" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian 
 and that "anachronism is still one of the most
 obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history."`,

    body: `# Digital marketing
#### March 17, 1971  by [ Ray Tomlinson](/)
Digital marketing is the component of marketing that uses the Internet and online based digital
 technologies such as desktop computers, mobile phones and other digital media and platforms 
 to promote products and services.[2][3] Its development during the 1990s and 2000s changed the 
 way brands and businesses use technology for marketing. As digital platforms became increasingly 
 incorporated into marketing plans and everyday life,[4] and as people increasingly use digital devices 
 instead of visiting physical shops,[5][6] digital marketing campaigns have become prevalent, employing 
 combinations of search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), content marketing, 
 influencer marketing, content automation, campaign marketing, data-driven marketing, e-commerce marketing, 
 social media marketing, social media optimization, e-mail direct marketing, display advertising, 
 e–books, and optical disks and games have become commonplace. Digital marketing extends to non-Internet
  channels that provide digital media, such as television, mobile phones (SMS and MMS), callback, 
  and on-hold mobile ring tones.The extension to non-Internet channels differentiates digital 
  marketing from online marketing
  ## History
  The development of digital marketing is inseparable from technology development. One of the first key events
   happened in 1971, when Ray Tomlinson sent the first email, and his technology set the platform to allow 
   people to send and receive files through different machines.[9] However, the more recognizable period as
    being the start of Digital Marketing is 1990 as this was where the Archie search engine was created as an
     index for FTP sites. In the 1980s, the storage capacity of computers was already big enough to store huge
      volumes of customer information. 
  Companies started choosing online techniques, such as database marketing, rather than limited list broker

- Affiliate marketing is a marketing arrangement in which affiliates receive a 
  commission for each visit, signup or sale they generate for a merchant.
- Marketing Communications (MC, marcom(s), marcomm(s) or just simply communications) refers to the use of different marketing channels 
  and tools in combination.
- Search engine marketing (SEM) is a form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility
 in search engine results pages (SERPs) primarily through paid advertising

  description:"After independence, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, initiated reforms to promote higher education and science and technology in India.[2] The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)—conceived by a 22-member committee of scholars and entrepreneurs in order to promote technical education—was inaugurated on 18 August 1951 at Kharagpur in West Bengal by the minister of education Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.[3] More IITs were soon opened in Bombay, Madras, Kanpur and Delhi as well in the late 1950s and early 1960s along with the regional RECs (now National Institutes of Technology (NIT). Beginning in the 1960s, close ties with the Soviet Union enabled the Indian Space Research Organisation to rapidly develop the Indian space program and advance nuclear power in India even after the first nuclear test explosion by India on 18 May 1974 at Pokhran.On 18 November 2008, the Moon Impact probe was released from Chandrayaan-1 at a height of 100 km (62 mi). During its 25-minute descent, Chandra's Altitudinal Composition Explorer (CHACE) recorded evidence of water in 650 mass spectra readings gathered during this time.[34] On 24 September 2009 Science journal reported that the Chandrayaan-1 had detected water ice on the Moon.Chandrayaan-2 was launched on 22 July 2019. It was a partial success: The team wanted to send an additional lander with rover Vikram with the original orbiter in it, to mark India's terrestrial presence on Moon, but the signal connection was lost about 2.1 km (1.3 mi) above the lunar surface. Over several months team tried to resume contact with lander, but ended up with no success. Later, by the late February 2020, it was claimed that an Indian software engineer from Chennai living in USA studied the NASA data of the proposed crashed site and found the Lander.Chandrayaan-3 is a next planned mission of sending only the lander with rover inside on the Moon, with the Japan's JAXA. It was delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic",
